# TODO (once I get it working in general at all)

- [x] line-breaks etc in output
- [x] restructure page to be more convenient scrolling-wise
- [x] add select-all button
- [x] include ToC showing what was/wasn't included
- [x] make downloaded file have a very good filename
- [ ] markdown
- [ ] make a better warning if it fails to extract the text
- [ ] replace alert() with smoother things
- [ ] options to do things other than markdown (currently ugly and doesn't auto-switch)
- [ ] favicon
- [ ] fix weird bug where the labels are referring to the wrong checkboxes
- [ ] make right stuff show/hide way saner - it's currently all sub-items
